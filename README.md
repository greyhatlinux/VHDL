# VHDL

VHDL stands for very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language. It is a programming language used to model a digital system by dataflow, physical behavioral and structural style of modeling

Execution of a VHDL program results in a simulation of the digital system. It allows us to validate the design prior to fabrication.

Structure and behavior are complementary ways of describing systems.

* A description of the behavior of a system says nothing about the structure or the components that make up the system.
* There are many ways in which you can build a system to provide the same behavior.
